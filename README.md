# Wireguard VPN configuration wizard

A Wireguard configuration wizard written in Java.

This program was written during the BTI7301-Project-1 module at the Bern University of Applied Sciences Engineering and Information Technology.

The config wizard will help you setup a VPN connection using the Wireguard technology (https://www.wireguard.com/)

## Installing

To run the program, simply run the JAR file:

```
java -jar wireguard-vpn-config-wizard.jar
```

## Development

Simply clone the repository and import it into your favorite Java IDE.

In the util/dev directory you can find some Vagrantfiles (https://www.vagrantup.com/) that help you test the generated configurations. See the README files for more information

Use the included build.sh script to build the project. We have decided way too late to use Maven, which would have been way better.
