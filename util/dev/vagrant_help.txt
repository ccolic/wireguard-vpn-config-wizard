# Explanation of the vagrant development setup

- Install virtualbox (https://www.virtualbox.org/) and vagrant (https://www.vagrantup.com/)
- Setup virtualbox as your default vagrant provider (https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/providers/default.html)
- Change to the util/dev directory and choose one of the test setups
    Each setup will start some VMs that you can use to test the generated configurations
    You can run the install and setup scripts and troubleshoot the VPN connection
- You can check the VM status with "vagrant status"
- Access the VMs with "vagrant ssh VM_NAME"
