                                                - 192.168.254.101 --- client-1
172.16.10.10 --- site --- 192.168.254.100   ----- 192.168.254.102 --- client-2
                                                - 192.168.254.103 --- client-3

the site has a 172.16.10.0/24 network "behind" it, that the clients should be able to access
